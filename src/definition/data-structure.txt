***ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: to better organize and store data so that it can be used efficiently.Efficient data structures are key to
efficient algorithm.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: various operations can be performed on different data structures such as creation, insertion, deletion, searching,
sorting, traversing, merging, appending, updating.

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer: buying tickets online represents a queue data structure. library books organized kind of like hashMap

What is an Array?
Answer: is an object that contains a certain number of values of the same type

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:An array is a dynamically-created object. Once an array is created, we cannot change its size. ArrayList is a
class of Collections framework. ArrayList can resize if needed. ArrayList cannot hold primitive data type values unlike
Array. Arrays are faster due to the fixed size, ArrayLists have slow performance.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer: The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type. The list has a pointer
to the first container and each container has a pointer to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list,
the element is placed into a new container and that container is pointed/linked to one of the other containers in the list.

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: Arrays are faster at storing and accessing data while LinkedList is faster at manipulation of data.
The linked list is dynamic in size while the array is static.

What is a Queue?
Answer: data structure designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning
of the queue.

What is a Stack (not Java memory - refers to data structure)?
Answer: The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. It is based on
Last-In-First-Out ( LIFO ).

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: First In First Out, Last In First Out, used to describe handling data structures.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O Notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. It helps to estimate
how long an algorithm takes to run.

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: searching by hash value

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer:

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together
to represent or simulate hierarchy. A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in
a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels. In the Tree
data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer:  Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes/vertices and edges/lines.
A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper
synchronization code. Hashtable is synchronized. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable
doesn’t allow any null key or value. HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model
Answer: RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)

        · Network data model – Graph

        · Hierarchical data model – Trees

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer:A HashMap stores items in "key/value" pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type.
One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value).

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs whenever we are trying to access any item of an array at an index which is
not present in the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: Using the clone() method, using the System.arraycopy() method, copying element by element

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) are the most popular tree traversal algorithms. Both
techniques include visiting all the edges and vertices of a graph but the most important difference between them is that
they perform different data structures. BFS applies queue data structure and DFS applies the stack data structure.

What is Recursion?
Answer: a process in which a method calls itself continuously.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: The main difference between linear and non linear data structures is that linear data structures arrange data in
a sequential manner while nonlinear data structures arrange data in a hierarchical manner, creating a relationship among
the data elements.


Outline different sorting algorithms and their time complexities:
	             Best	        Average	    Worst
Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	        θ(n^2)  	O(n^2)
Bubble Sort 	Ω(n)	        θ(n^2)	    O(n^2)
Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	        θ(n^2)	    O(n^2)
Heap Sort	    Ω(n log(n)) 	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Quick Sort	    Ω(n log(n))	    θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
Merge Sort   	Ω(n log(n))	    θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a) In terms of Accessing elements:
  b) In terms of Inserting elements:
  c) In terms of Searching elements:
  d) In terms of Removing elements:
